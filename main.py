'''
ADD, UPDATE, LIST, REMOVE, EXIT.
in order to make the code easier to understand, I'm going to write a seperate 
function for each of the commands, then call them in the main() function 
'''

#function to add a task, as a parameter i'm passing the list of commands
#we already have 
def addTask(commands):
    #prompts for the name of the task
    nameTask = input("Enter the name of the task you want to add: ")
    #check if the task exists already, if so, suggest updating the description
    if(command)

def updateTask():

def listTasks():

def removeTask():



def main():

    '''
    commands will looks like this
    [
        {
            "name" : task_name,
            "description" : task_desc
        },
        {
            "name": task_name2.
            "description" : task_desc2

        }
    ]
    '''
    commands = [{}]
